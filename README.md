For this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used a font library from Font Spring. 

### How to play Mancala  
Object: Be the first player to shift all marbles off your side. The winner has the greatest number of stones in their end pit (located on either end of the board).  

To start: Player One's pits are on the top row of the board, Player Two is on the bottom row. The game starts with three stones in each pit.  

Click on a pit on your side of the board to move the stones, the board will move the stones clockwise.  

If your last stone is placed in your own end well, you receive an extra turn.  

To end play: The game ends when one of the two players' side is empty of stones.


### History of Mancala
One of the oldest games in the world, Mancala has been played for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians, Ethiopians living in the 6th and 7th centuries AD, and many others.  

The word mancala comes from the Arabic word _naqala_, meaning "to move."

## Now what is Cottagecore you may ask?  
Cottagecore is a fashion and lifestyle aesthetic popularized on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. The aesthetic is a reminder to occasionally slow down, enjoy nature and enjoy the beauty that surrounds us.

### What's in the icebox? (Future improvements)  
Future improvements to the game include a "live" background like a gif that increases the cottage feel, improved styling on the board pits, and sounds added for the stones clinking onto the board. What would you like to add? Let me know!  

Thank you for playing Cottagecore Mancala with me! I hope you'll stop by my little cottage in the forest again soon.
